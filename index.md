# Welcome
My name is Honghuang Lin (林泓煌). Welcome to my personal website.

The goal of creating this website is to:
* Host a more maintainable [CV](/cv/)
* Provide an overview/summary of my research work
* Gather my learning notes or dev notes in the [Posts](/posts/) to create my knowledge base
* Have a "personal website" that can be included in my profile :)
